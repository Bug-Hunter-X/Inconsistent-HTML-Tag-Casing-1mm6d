<p>This is a common mistake in HTML that often goes unnoticed.  It involves using the wrong casing for HTML tags.  HTML is case-insensitive in many aspects, but for consistency and to avoid unexpected behavior, especially when working with more complex systems, it's best practice to maintain proper capitalization.</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;This is a &lt;p&gt;paragraph&lt;/P&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>Notice that the closing &lt;/P&gt; tag has an uppercase 'P'. This is incorrect; HTML tags should be consistently lowercase, like &lt;/p&gt;.</p>
